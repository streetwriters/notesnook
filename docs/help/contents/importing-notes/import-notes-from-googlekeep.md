# How do I import notes from Google Keep?

The following steps will help you quickly import your notes from Google Keep into Notesnook.

## Exporting your Google Keep notes

1. Go to [Google Takeout](https://takeout.google.com/settings/takeout) and log into your Google account.
2. On the Google Takeout page, first deselect all the items by clicking on `Deselect all`, and then scroll down and select only `Keep` from the list. Once selected, click on `Next Step` by scrolling to the very bottom of the page.

1. Open the Notesnook app (web or desktop)
2. Go to `Settings > Notesnook Importer` and select `Google Keep` from list of apps.
