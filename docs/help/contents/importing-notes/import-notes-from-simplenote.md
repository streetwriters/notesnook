## Supported formats

Simplenote's export is, well, pretty simple and the Notesnook Importer supports 100% of it. It also preserves all the formatting and indenting in the imported notes.

## Troubleshooting

### Some of my notes have weird whitespacing and broken formatting after import. What do I do?

This can happen in notes for which you have enabled Markdown in Simplenote. Notesnook Importer follows this flag during processing and respects Markdown rules during the conversion to HTML. If you want to preserve the formatting of your notes, it is best that you disable the Markdown formatting for all your notes in Simplenote. This will force the Notesnook Importer to import all your notes as plaintext.
