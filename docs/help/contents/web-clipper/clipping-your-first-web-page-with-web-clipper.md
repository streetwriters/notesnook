## Selecting the clipping area

The [web clipper](https://notesnook.com/notesnook-web-clipper) provides a few options to help you clip exactly the part of the page you need:

![Notesnook Web Clipper clipping area options](/static/web-clipper/clipping-area.png)

### Full page

The `Full page` mode clips the web page from top to bottom including every possible detail. This mode is also the largest in size & consequently takes longer to clip.

### Article

The `Article` mode is best for blogs & articles on the web because it tries to finds the "content" part of the page using a couple of heuristics. It works similar to Firefox's Reader Mode.

### Visible area

The `Visible area` mode clips only the nodes that fit in the viewport. Any nodes that are partially in the viewport are also included.

### Selected nodes

The `Selected nodes` mode allows you to select exactly which nodes you want to clip:

1. Select the `Selected nodes` mode from the Notesnook Web Clipper
2. You should now see a small popup in the bottom-right corner of the page

3. Click on all the nodes you want to clip (they can be in any part of the screen).
   > info
   >
   > The web clipper stacks all the selected nodes vertically during final processing.
4. Clicking again on the selected nodes will deselect them.
5. Once you are done, click on the Clip button
6. Activate the Notesnook Web Clipper and save your clip.

## Selecting the clipping mode

The clipping mode controls how the final clip should look.

### Bookmark

`Bookmark` mode saves only the URL of the page along with the title. It is best suited to save pages for later reading/reference.

### Simplified

`Simplified` mode doesn't include any styles. It is best suited for long-form content such as articles & blogs. All clips in `Simplified` mode are saved directly as is i.e. they do not appear as web clip embeds in the Notesnook editor.

### Screenshot

> info Pro users only
>
> `Screenshot` mode is only available to Pro users

`Screenshot` mode includes all the styles + images but the final result is saved as an image i.e. it is non-interactive.

### Complete with styles

> info Pro users only
>
> `Complete with styles` mode is only available to Pro users

`Complete with styles` mode saves all images, styles & everything on the page to retain the maximum amount of information. The final result appears as an embed in the Notesnook editor which is full interactive.
