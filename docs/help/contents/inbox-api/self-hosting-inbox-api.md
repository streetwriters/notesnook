# Self-Hosting Inbox API

As you might've noticed, the incoming data the user sends to the inbox is unencrypted. Which is why the inbox API is served from a separate server. This allows us to self-host the inbox server without self-hosting the entire NN stack.

You can read how to self-host inbox server here: https://github.com/streetwriters/notesnook-sync-server/blob/master/Notesnook.Inbox.API/README.md
