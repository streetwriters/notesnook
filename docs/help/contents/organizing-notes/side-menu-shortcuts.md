# Side menu shortcuts

Unlike most note taking apps, you might have noticed that when you add a tag or create a notebook, they are not added automatically to the side menu for quick access. We have seen people with 100's of tags, all on the side menu. Managing those tags from there and finding what you are looking for becomes a pain as your notes collection grows.

To tackle this, we have added shortcuts which give you control of what you want to see on your side menu. You can add shortcuts of tags and notebooks to side menu.
