# Note version history

Notesnook keeps a constant log of all your edit sessions. These are stored as "versions" of a particular notes which you can view & restore to in case of data loss.

## How it works

Every time you create a new note or open an existing note, Notesnook creates a "session" for it. All the changes made to the note are also stored in that session in addition to the note itself.

In short, if you open a note and edit it at 10 different times during the day, you'll have 10 previous versions of that note.

## FAQs

### Is note history synced to all my devices?

No, at the moment we have decided to keep note version history local only. If you logout from your account, previous versions of all your notes will be cleared.
