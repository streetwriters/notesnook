# Locking notes

Notesnook is a private notes app. All your notes are encrypted and secure by default. We can not read your notes even if we want to on our servers. However you can still add an extra layer of security and encrypt your most important and sensitive notes by adding them to a vault.

Adding notes to private vault is useful when you do not want anyone to read your notes, _even if they have access to your phone_.

## Open/edit/delete a locked note

To open, edit or delete a locked note, you must provide the password for the vault to unlock it.

## Keep note unlocked when it is opened

By default, when you open a locked note, it will be locked again after you close the note or lock the vault. You can change this behavior, so that the note remains unlocked even after you close it. Now the note will only be locked when the vault is locked.
