# Is there an ETA for X feature?

![](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/estimating_time.png)

We maintain an up-to-date [roadmap](https://notesnook.com/roadmap) which lists everything we are working on and everything we plan on adding in the future. There is no certainty _when_ something might land, though. It can be days, months, or even years before a feature becomes generally available. Asking us for ETAs is annoying and distracts us from what really matters.

## Why we don't provide ETAs

In case you are still curious, a huge part of developing any software are **deadlines**. Giving any ETA means we want to be held accountable for when a feature might land. That is something we cannot afford because another huge part of developing any software are **delays**. As any engineer might tell you, "X will land in 1 month" almost always means "X will land in 4 months".

Users do not understand or tolerate delays, and developers do not like incessant pestering on why something didn't land on X date when we said it'll land on X date. To avoid all these headaches we simply do not give out any ETAs. Obviously, internally we do have timelines for each feature but disclosing these is unnecessary.

In short, it'll land when it'll land. No promises.
